# Heya!
I'm Rexo. When not playing games I like to code, and open source is :ok_hand:. I mainly focus on JS/TS as that's where my knowledge is (although I'd describe myself as something of a beginner), however I also know some Python.

## My repositories
- I'm a client dev/tiager for [**Revolt**](https://github.com/revoltchat). You can usually see me working on [**Revite**](https://github.com/revoltchat/revite) (written in TS using React and Vite) or [Revolt's documentation](https://github.com/revoltchat/documentation).
- **JS:** [**Termivolt**](https://github.com/rexogamer/termivolt) is an NPM package that lets you interact with the Revolt API.
- **TS:** [**RexBot**](https://github.com/rexogamer/rexbot) is a multipurpose Revolt bot. From getting info on Wikipedia articles to searching the NPM registry (and quite a bit more!), there's plenty of useful functionality in this bot. 
- **PY:** [**iSHUpdater**](https://github.com/rexogamer/ishupdater) is a little tool I made for updating [iSH](https://github.com/ish-app/ish) that updates Alpine and the MOTD (if you put the version in there like myself). More niche but it's handy for me.

## Contacting me
- You can DM me on [**Discord**](https://discord.com) (`Rexowogamer#1183`) or [**Revolt**](https://revolt.chat) (`Rexogamer`). These are the best was to contact me as I check Discord and Revolt frequently.
- If you're not a fan of Discord, I'm also on [**Matrix**](https://matrix.org) at rexogamer:mozilla.org.
- I also have [**Twitter!**](https://twitter.com) I accept DMs from anyone (you don't need me to be following you). My handle is [@RexogamerS.](https://twitter.com/@RexogamerS)
- Finally, if you're not a fan of more modern services like these, you can send an **email** to the publicly listed email on my profile ([beartechtalks@gmail.com](mailto:beartechtalks@gmail.com)).
