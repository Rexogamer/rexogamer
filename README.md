# Heya!
I'm Rexo. When not playing games I like to code, and open source is :ok_hand:. I mainly focus on JS/TS as that's where my knowledge is (although I'd describe myself as something of a beginner), however I also know some Python.

## My repositories
- **JS:** [**Cytrus-RE**](https://github.com/cytrus-re/cytrus-re) is a multi-purpose Discord bot, including quite a few handy little features like GitHub/NPM searching. You can invite it to your server via the link in the README.
- **HTML:** [**cytrus-re.github.io**](https://github.com/cytrus-re/cytrus-re.github.io) is Cytrus-RE's website, and includes a command list and info on the devs, with more to come in the future :eyes:
- **PY:** [**iSHUpdater**](https://github.com/rexogamer/ishupdater) is a little tool I made for updating [iSH](https://github.com/ish-app/ish) that updates Alpine and the MOTD (if you put the version in there like myself). Probably more niche but it's handy for me.
- **JS:** [**Rias-EN**](https://github.com/rexogamer/Rias-EN) is an English translation of a French music bot made by @Sworder71.

## Contacting me
- You can DM me on [**Discord**](https://discord.com) at Rexowogamer#1183. This is the best way to contact me as I check Discord frequently.
- If you're not a fan of Discord, I'm also on [**Matrix**](https://matrix.org) at rexogamer:mozilla.org.
- I also have [**Twitter!**](https://twitter.com) I accept DMs from anyone (you don't need me to be following you). My handle is [@RexogamerS.](https://twitter.com/@RexogamerS)
- Finally, if you're not a fan of more modern services like these, you can send an **email** to the publicly listed email on my profile ([beartechtalks@gmail.com](mailto:beartechtalks@gmail.com)). (Tip: if it's about Cytrus-RE in particular, you can also [email help.ttsbotsnapps@gmail.com](mailto:help.ttsbotsnapps@gmail.com); this is prefered as it means I know what you want help with quicker and means your email is more likely to be seen.)
