# heya!
I'm Rexo. when not playing games I like to code - and I'm quite a fan of open source software. I mainly focus on JS/TS as that's where my knowledge is, although I'd describe myself as something of a beginner.

for more info about my projects - as well as various ways to contact me - go to [my website](https://rexogamer.github.io/?utm_source=github-readme). you can find its source code [here](https://github.com/rexogamer/rexogamer.github.io) :3
